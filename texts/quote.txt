Hi [customer],

Please make sure everything is correct including the specifications, as all sales are final and we are unable to accept returns/exchanges. We are happy to answer any questions about product features! If you are ordering an Apple product(s), and have not already requested it, please let us know if youâ€™d like to add an AppleCare+ warranty to your quote so your device has extended warranty coverage.

If you are ready to order, you can email your info and shipping address and we will place the order. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, you may encounter longer than usual ship times from our vendors.

Let us know if you would like to make any changes or have any questions.

Thank you,
[name]
Example Company
